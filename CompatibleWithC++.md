- **Compatible to C++**, C and maybe other languages of this „language family“
    - as with
        - Java: Kotlin, Scala, Groovy, Clojure, Fantom, Ceylon, Jython, JRuby …
        - C#: C++/CLI, F#, Visual Basic .NET, Ada, IronPython, IronRuby …
        - Objective-C: Swift
    - Possible to include
        - C++ headers and modules from Cone
        - Cone headers and modules from C++
    - Language is recognised by
        - the file extension
            - C++: *.cpp *.hpp *.cxx *.hxx *.h
            - C: *.c *.h
                - *.h is of course a problem, but can probably best be solved using path based rules.
            - Cone: *.cone *.hone *.c1 *.h1 *.co *.ho
        - path based rules
            - C++ standard headers in certain directories 
        - can be set in IDE
            - for each file individually
