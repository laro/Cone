# Cone
C++ with CamelCase style
C++ without semicolons

- Pronounced „see one“
- **Cone**, COne, cOne, c1, C1
- „Improved“ C++
    - with a **simplified** syntax,
    - in the style of Qt, Objective-C, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift
    - Isomorphic mapping of all C++ functionality to Cone possible
        - only with other/better/shorter „expression“.
    - -May I call this "modern"?-
    - C++ Successor Language
        - like CppFront/Cpp2, Carbon or Circle
        - Similar to
            - C -> C++
            - Java -> Kotlin
            - Objective-C -> Swift
            - JavaScript -> TypeScrtipt
    - Uses the same compiler backend as C++ (clang, gcc, …)
        - with an own / a new compiler frontend (or a precompiler)
    - So no garbage collection 
        - Instead use
            - RAII (Resource Acquisition is Initialization)
                - RROD (Resource Release on Object Destruction)
            - SharedPtr<T> etc.
