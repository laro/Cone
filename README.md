# Cone
C++ with CamelCase style  
C++ without semicolons  
C++ with simplified syntax

- **Cone**, COne, cOne, c1, C1,  
  Pronounced „see one“
- „Improved“ C++
    - with a **simplified** syntax,
    - in the _style_ of Qt, Objective-C, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift
    - Isomorphic mapping of all C++ functionality to Cone possible
        - only with other/better/shorter „expression“.
    - ~~May I call this "modern"?~~
    - C++ Successor Language
        - like CppFront/Cpp2, Carbon or Circle
        - Similar to
            - C -> C++
            - Java -> Kotlin
            - Objective-C -> Swift
            - JavaScript -> TypeScrtipt
    - Uses the same compiler backend as C++ (clang, gcc, …)
        - with an own / a new compiler frontend (or a precompiler)
    - So _no_ garbage collection 
        - Instead use
            - RAII (Resource Acquisition is Initialization)
                - RROD (Resource Release on Object Destruction)
            - SharedPtr<T> etc.

- **Compatible to C++**, C and maybe other languages of this „language family“
    - as with
        - Java: Kotlin, Scala, Groovy, Clojure, Fantom, Ceylon, Jython, JRuby …
        - C#: C++/CLI, F#, Visual Basic .NET, Ada, IronPython, IronRuby …
        - Objective-C: Swift
    - Possible to include
        - C++ headers and modules from Cone
        - Cone headers and modules from C++
    - Language is recognised by
        - the file extension
            - C++: *.cpp *.hpp *.cxx *.hxx *.h
            - C: *.c *.h
                - *.h is of course a problem, but can probably best be solved using path based rules.
            - Cone: *.cone *.hone *.c1 *.h1 *.co *.ho
        - path based rules
            - C++ standard headers in certain directories 
        - can be set in IDE
            - for each file individually 

## Style
- All types and standard classes in upper CamelCase
    - Style similar to Kotlin, Swift
    - Cone standard library („cone::“ instead of „std::“)
        - „std::string“ -> „cone::String“
        - „vector“ -> „Vector“
        - „map“ -> „Map“
            - „Dictionary“ as typedef with deprecation warning
        - „forward_list“ -> „ForwardList“
        - „unordered_map“ -> „UnorderedMap“
        - „value_type“ -> „ValueType“
        - Maybe some exceptions/variations:
            - „stringstream“ -> „Stringstream“ or „StringStream“?
                - „Textstream“ or TextStream“, „Bytestream“ or „ByteStream“, …
            - „multimap" -> „Multimap“ or „MultiMap“?
    - Arithmetic types
        - Bool
        - Int == Int32 or 64
            - Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, maybe Int128
        - UInt == UInt32 or 64
            - UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, maybe UInt128
        - BigInt (Arbitrary Precision Integer)
        - Float
            - Float16, Float32, Float64 (Half, Single, Double Precision Floating Point)
                - maybe Float128, Float256
            - BFloat16 (Brain Floating Point)
            - BigFloat for Arbitrary Precision Float
        - Byte == UInt8
        - Char == UInt8, CodePoint == UInt32

- Functions in lower camelCase
    - Roughly in the style of Qt, Objective-C/C++, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Kotlin, Swift

- Namespaces fully lowercase 
    - Standard namespace „cone“~~, „c1“ ~~

## Arithmetic Types
- Bool
    - not ~~bool~~ nor ~~Boolean~~
- Int, UInt
    - Int == Int64
        - Int == Int32 on 32 bit systems only (i.e. old/small platforms)
            - therefore it is _not_ necessary to have ~~Size or SSize~~
    - Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, maybe Int128, Int256
        - like int32_t or qint32, but no prefix „q“ nor postfix „_t,) and in CamelCase 
    - UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, maybe UInt128, UInt256
        - e.g. UInt256 for SHA256
- Byte == UInt8 (Alias)
- BigInt – Arbitrary Precision Integer
    - for cryptography, maybe computer algebra, numerics
    - see [Boost.Multiprecision](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/index.html), [GMP](https://gmplib.org)
- Float
    - Float == Float32
        - Among other things because this is how it works in C/C++
        - Is faster than Float64 and good enough most of the time
    - ~~Float == Float64~~
        - ~~Among other things because already in C/C++ „1.0“ == Float64 and „1.0f“ == Float32~~
        - ~~Float32 only on certain platforms~~
    - Float16, Float32, Float64 (half, single, double precision floating point)
        - maybe Float128, Float 256
            - typically probably realized as double-double respectively double-double-double-double
            - https://stackoverflow.com/a/6770329
    - BFloat16 (Brain Floating Point)
    - Mixed arithmetic:
        - „1 * aFloat“ is possible
            - Warning, if the Int literal cannot be reproduced exactly as Float32/64
        - „anInt * aFloat“ is possible
            - Warning that the Int variable may not be reproduced exactly as Float32/64, i.e. with
                - aFloat32 * anInt32/64    // Warning
                - aFloat32 * anInt8/16     // No warning
                - aFloat64 * anInt64       // Warning
                - aFloat64 * anInt8/16/32  // No warning
    - BigFloat for arbitrary precision float,
        - see [GMP](https://gmplib.org)
        - But where do algorithms stop whose results cannot be represented precisely?
            - For example: „1.0 / 3.0“

## Signed Size
Int (i.e. signed) as type for *.size()
- Because mixed integer arithmetic („signed - unsigned“) and „unsigned - unsigned“ is difficult to handle.
    - In C/C++ „anUInt - 1 >= 0“ is _always_ true (even if anUInt is 0)
- When working with sizes, calculating the difference is common; Then you are limited to PtrDiff (i.e. signed integer) anyway.
- Who needs more than 2GB of data in an „array“, should please use a 64 bit platform.
- For bounds checking, the two comparisons „x >= 0“ and  „x < width“ may very well be reduced to a single „UInt(x) < width“ _by the compiler_ in an optimization step. 
- Then types Size and SSize/PtrDiff are not necessary anymore, so two types less.
    - We simply use Int instead. Or UInt rate cases.
- Restricted rules for mixed integer arithmetic:
    - Unsigned +-*/ Signed is an error
        - you have to cast
        - Int (i.e. signed) is almost always used anyways
    - Error with „if (anUInt < 0)“
        - if the literal on the right is <= 0
    - Error with „if (anUInt < anInt)“
        - you have to cast
- Not:
    - ~~Size AKA UInt as type for *.size() (i.e. still unsigned)~~
        - ~~Size reads IMHO better than UInt~~
            - ~~Size would not really be necessary~~
        - ~~New rules for mixed integer arithmetic:~~
            - ~~Unsigned +-*/ Signed -> Signed.~~
                - ~~Signed is therefore considered the "larger" type compared to unsigned~~
                - ~~„1“ is Int (signed)~~
                    - ~~„1u“ is UInt (unsigned)~~
                - ~~Therefore „if (anUInt - 1 >= 0)“ is a useful expression („1“ is signed)~~
                - ~~But also „anUInt + 1 == anInt“~~
    - ~~Or~~
        - ~~Size - Size -> SSize~~
            - ~~Problem: „-“ results in SSize, but „+“ results in Size?!~~
        - ~~The conversion of a negative number into Size lead to an error instead of delivering a HUGE size ~~

## String, Char & CodePoint
- cone::String with UTF-8 support
    - Basic/standard unicode support (cone::String)
        - Iteration over:
            - code units (i.e. Bytes with UTF-8)
                - „for codeUnit in text.asArray()“
                - „for codeUnit in text.asCodeUnits()“?
                - ~~„for codeUnit in text.byCodeUnit()“?~~
                - ~~„for codeUnit in text.byChar()“?~~
            - code points (always UInt32, with UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32)
                - „for codePoint in text.asCodePoints()“
                - ~~„for codePoint in text.byCodePoint()“?~~
            - grapheme clusters (i.e. may consist of multiple code points, default form of iteration, using StringView)
                - for graphemeCluster in „abc 🥸“ (this is the default type of iteration)
                - additional/alternative names?
                    - for graphemeCluster in text.asGraphemeClusters()? (as
                    - ~~for graphemeCluster in text.byGraphemeCluster()?~~
    - Advanced support based on [ICU](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/icu4c/) („International Components for Unicode“, „ICU4C“).
        - „The ICU libraries provide support for:
            - The latest version of the Unicode standard
            - Character set conversions with support for over 220 codepages
            - Locale data for more than 300 locales
            - Language sensitive text collation (sorting) and searching based on the Unicode Collation Algorithm (=ISO 14651)
            - Regular expression matching and Unicode sets
            - Transformations for normalization, upper/lowercase, script transliterations (50+ pairs)
            - Resource bundles for storing and accessing localized information
            - Date/Number/Message formatting and parsing of culture specific input/output formats
            - Calendar specific date and time manipulation
            - Text boundary analysis for finding characters, word and sentence boundaries“
        - „import icu“ adds extension methods for cone::String
            - Allows iteration over:
                - words (important/difficult for Chinese, Japanese, Thai or Khmer, needs list of words)
                    - „for word in text.asWords()“
                    - ~~„for word in text.byWord()“~~
                - lines
                    - „for word in text.asLines()“
                    - ~~„for line in text.byLine()“~~
                - sentences (needs list of abbreviations, like „e.g.“, „i.e.“, „o.ä.“)
                    - „for sentence in text.asSentences()“
                    - ~~„for sentence in text.bySentence()“~
    - string.toUpper(), string.toLower()
        - toUpper(Sting) -> String
        - toLower(Sting) -> String
    - Sorting
- StringView
    - to iterate over all grapheme clusters (i.e. may consist of multiple code points) of a string
        - for grapheme in „abc 🥸👮🏻“
            - „a“, „b“, „c“, „ “, „🥸“, „👮🏻“
            - „\x61“, „\x62“, „\x63“, „\x20“, „\xf0\x9f\xa5\xb8“, „\xf0\x9f\x91\xae\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb“
    - A bit slow, as it has to find grapheme cluster boundaries.
    - It is recommended to mostly use the standard functions for string manipulation anyway, you seldomly need grapheme-based iteration. But when you do, this probably is the correct way. 
- CodePoint == UInt32
    - to iterate over all code points of a string,
            - for codePoint in „abc 🥸👮🏻“.asCodePoints()
            - 0x61, 0x62, 0x63, 0x20, 0x1F978, 0x1F46E, 0x1F3FB 
    - Independent of the encoding (so, the same for UTF-8/16/32),
        - called „auto decoding“ in D.
    - A bit faster, but still slow, as it has to find code point boundaries in UTF-8/16 strings.
    - Fast with UTF-32, **but** even with UTF-32 not all graphemes/characters fit into a single code point,
        - so not:
            - emoji with modifier characters like skin tone or variation selector,
            - diacritical characters (äöü…, depending on the normal form chosen),
            - surely some more …
        - Often slower than UTF-8, due to its size (cache, memory bandwidth)
- Char == Char8 == UInt8
    - to iterate over all code units (bytes/characters) of an UTF-8 string,
        - for ch in „abc 🥸👮🏻“.asArray()
        - for ch in „abc 🥸👮🏻“utf8.asArray()
        - for ch in UTF8String(„abc 🥸👮🏻“).asArray()
            - 0x61, 0x62, 0x63, 0x20, &nbsp; 0xf0, 0x9f, 0xa5, 0xb8, &nbsp; 0xf0, 0x9f, 0x91, 0xae, 0xf0, 0x9f, 0x8f, 0xbb
    - to iterate over all bytes/characters of an ASCII string,
        - for ch in „abc“ascii
            - Compilation error, if string contains non-ASCII characters.
        - for ch in ASCIIString(„abc“)
            - Exception thrown, if string contains non-ASCII characters.
            - 0x61, 0x62, 0x63
            - ‚a‘, ‚b‘, ‚c‘
    - to iterate over all bytes/characters of a Latin1 (ISO 8859-1) string,
        - for ch in „äbc“latin1
            - Compilation error, if string contains non-Latin1 characters.
        - for ch in Latin1String(„äbc“)
            - Exception thrown, if string contains non-Latin1 characters.
            - 0xe4, 0x62, 0x63
            - ‚ä‘, ‚b‘, ‚c‘
- Char16 == UInt16
    - to iterate over strings encoded as UTF-16 with „.asArray()“
        - for ch16 in „abc 🥸👮🏻“utf16.asArray()
        - for ch16 in UTF16String(„abc 🥸👮🏻“).asArray()
            - 0x0061, 0x0062, 0x0063, 0x0020, &nbsp; 0xD83E, 0xDD78, &nbsp; 0xD83D, 0xDC6E, 0xD83C, 0xDFFB
- Char32 == UInt32
    - to iterate over strings encoded as UTF-32 with „.asArray()“
        - for ch32 in „abc 🥸👮🏻“utf32.asArray()
        - for ch32 in UTF32String(„abc 🥸👮🏻“).asArray()
            - 0x00000061, 0x00000062, 0x00000063, 0x00000020, &nbsp; 0x0001F978, &nbsp; 0x0001F46E , 0x0001F3FB
- Char8 == UInt8, Char16 == UInt16, Char32 == UInt32
    - (considered as _different_ types for parameter overloading)
- So no ~~WideChar~~
    - ~~Or is it useful for portable code (Linux UInt32 <-> Windows UInt16)?~~
        - ~~You may use wchar_t then.~~
     
## Namespace "cone"
Standard namespace is „cone“~~, „c1“~~ (instead of "std")
- With Cone version of every standard class/concept (i.e. uppercase class names and camelCase function and variable names)
    - e.g. „cone::String : protected std::string“
- „**Alias**“ for 
    - member variables
        ```
        using x = data[0]  
         using y = data[1]
        ```
        - ~~or `alias x = data[0]`?~~
        - Not quite possible in C++.
            - With …
                ```
                Float& imaginary = im
                T& x = data[0]
                ```
            - … unfortunately memory is created for the reference (the pointer).
            - And this indeed is necessary here, because the reference could be assigned differently in the constructor,
                - so it is not possible to optimieren it away.
    - member functions
        - `using f() = g()`
        - ~~Or is perfect forwarding enough?~~
            - ~~https://stackoverflow.com/a/9864472~~
            - This would not work for virtual functions

## Const Reference as Default Type
- Const reference/value as default type for function call arguments and for „for-in“ (AKA „for-each“, „foreach“)
    - „`mutable`“, to mark as changeable
        - Also at the caller `swap(mutable a, mutable b)`
        - ~~Or `inout`?~~
    - `value`, to mark as value (not reference) 
        - `mutable value`
        - Is not specified when calling the function, as a copy is created here.
    - `reference`, to mark as reference (not value)
    - RValue references still as `&&`
    - Type traits `default_argument_type`
        - As const _value_:
            - `Int`, `Float`, `Bool` etc.
            - Small classes (as `Complex<Float>`, `StringView`) 
        - As const _reference_:
            - All other cases
        - Therefore probably best to have const reference as general default, „list of exceptions“ for the „value types“.
        - ~~Or (similar to C# and Swift) const-reference for `classes`, const-value for `structs`?~~
            - ~~At least as default?~~
    - Examples:
        - `concat(String first, String second)`
            - instead of `concat(const String& first, const String& second)`
        - `String[] stringArray = ["a", "b", "c"]   
          for str in stringArray  { … }`
            - `str` is `const String&`
            - If you want to have it differently:
                - „`for mutable str in stringArray  { … }“`
                    - „`str`“ is „`String&`“
                - „`for value str in stringArray  { … }“`
                    - „`str`“ is „`const String`“
                - „`for mutable value str in stringArray { … }“`
                    - „`str`“ is „`String`“
        - „`for str in ["a", "b", "c"]  { … }`“
            - „`str`" is „`const StringView`“
        - „`for i in [1, 2, 3] { … }“`
            - „`i`“ is „`const Int`“
            - If you want to have it differently:
                - „`for mutable i in [1, 2, 3] { … }`“
                    - „`i`“ is „`Int`“
                - „`for reference i in [1, 2, 3] { … }`“
                    - „`i`“ is „`const Int&“`
                - „`for mutable reference i in [1, 2, 3] { … `}“
                    - „`i`“ is „`Int&“`
        - If you want even the basic type to be different:
            - „`for Double d in [1, 2, 3]  { … }“`
                - „`d`“ is „`const Double`“
            - „`for String str in ["a", "b", "c"]  { … }“`
                - „`str`“ is „`const String&“`
            - „`for mutable String str in ["a", "b", "c"]  { … }“`
                - „`str`“ is „`String&“`
            - „`for value String str in ["a", "b", "c"]  { … }`“
                - „`str`“ is „`const String`“
            - „`for mutable value String str in ["a", "b", "c"]  { … }`“
                - „`str`“ is „`String`“
        - `for i in 1..<10 { … }`
            - `i` is `const Int`
